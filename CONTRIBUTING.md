# Contributing to WEB MES
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer
- Tell me that what I'm doing wrong (and yes i m not an professional= D ..)

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/SMEWebify/WebErpMesv2/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/SMEWebify/WebErpMesv2/issues/new); it's that easy!
